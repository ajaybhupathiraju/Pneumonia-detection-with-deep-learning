## Project Overview
Pneumonia is an infection in lungs caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi. It's a significant public health issue that often requires timely and accurate diagnosis for effective treatment. This project aims to develop a deep learning model, specifically using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to automatically detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The proposed model focuses on efficiently identifying pneumonia, assisting healthcare professionals in diagnosis.

## Data Sources
   Chest X-ray Images from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)

## Tools and Frameworklib

  Programming Language   : Python
  
  Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow and Keras,Scikit-learn,Matplotlib
  
  Dataset                : Chest X-ray dataset
  
  Tools                  : Jupyter Notebook / Pycharm

## Exploratory Data Analysis

## Data preprocessing
1. **Resizing images**    : Since the dataset contains x-ray images of different dimensions to make it consistent, I converted the dimensions to a standard size (64 X 64) which improves train the model will be faster.
2. **Normalization**      : Scaling pixel values b/w 0 to 1 to make training faster and efficient.
3. **Data Augumentation** : Apply transformations like rotation, flipping and zooming etc artificially which increase the dataset size to avoid model overfitting.

## Transfer learning      :
Pretrained models by large dataset we will be using to reduce training time and compare the results.

**limitation** :
 It's a huge dataset. Due to limitations of my GPU (RTX 4060Ti 16GB, 128-bit) and time constraints, I could not run algorithms at higher epochs.
 
## Performance metrics
accuracy_score

## Loss function
binary crossentropy

## Choosing a model

**Unbalanced datase**t : 90% vs 10% - **validation accuracy 62%**

I will fit below all models and choose best fit model.

Note : GPU configuration - RTX 4060Ti 16GB with 4352 cuda cores

**Balanced datase**t : 60% vs 40% - **validation accuracy 91%** <br/>
Due to data unbalance we notice most of our models are overfit ( custom VGG16). To avoid overfit problem we apply tunning on 

1. Balance data distribution
2. Reduce the no of layers and no of nuerons
3. Applied l2 regularizer
4. Earily stoping feature
