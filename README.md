## Project Overview
  Pneumonia is an infection in lungs caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi. Pneumonia causes lung tissue to swell (inflammation) and can cause fluid or pus in your lungs. 
  Bacterial pneumonia is usually more severe than viral pneumonia, which often resolves on its own.Pneumonia can affect one or both lungs.
  We develop a deep machine learning model to detect the pneumonia in patients.
