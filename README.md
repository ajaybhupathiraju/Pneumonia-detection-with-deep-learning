## Project Overview
  Pneumonia is an infection in lungs caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi. Pneumonia causes lung tissue to swell (inflammation) and can cause fluid or pus in your lungs. 
  
  Pneumonia is a significant public health issue that often requires timely and accurate diagnosis for effective treatment. This project aims to develop a deep learning model, specifically using Convolutional Neural 
  Networks (CNN), to automatically detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The proposed model focuses on efficiently identifying pneumonia, assisting healthcare professionals in diagnosis.
