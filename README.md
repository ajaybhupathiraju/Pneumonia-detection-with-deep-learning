## Project Overview
  Pneumonia is an infection in lungs caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi. Pneumonia causes lung tissue to swell (inflammation) and can cause fluid or pus in your lungs. Bacterial pneumonia is usually more severe   
  than viral pneumonia, which often resolves on its own.Pneumonia can affect one or both lungs. Pneumonia in both of your lungs is called bilateral or double pneumonia.We develop a deep machine learning model to   
  detect the pneumonia in patients.
